# Protocol Class Implementation Changes

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to the `Protocol` class implementation to improve its functionality, safety, and maintainability. The changes align the implementation with the professor's code while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase.

## Key Changes

### 1. Protocol Number and Traits
- Changed protocol number to use `Traits<Protocol>::ETHERNET_PROTOCOL_NUMBER` instead of hardcoded value
- This ensures proper protocol number configuration through traits system
- Maintains consistency with the professor's implementation

### 2. Observer Pattern Implementation
- Replaced `Concurrent_Observer` and `Concurrent_Observed` with `Conditional_Data_Observer` and `Conditionally_Data_Observed`
- This aligns with the professor's implementation and provides better data handling
- Improved thread safety and data consistency

### 3. Message Structure
- Added `Header` class for protocol message headers
  - Includes from_port, to_port, and size fields
  - Provides proper encapsulation of header data
- Added `Packet` class that inherits from Header
  - Includes data buffer for message content
  - Uses packed attribute for proper memory layout
  - Provides type-safe data access through template methods

### 4. MTU and Data Handling
- Added proper MTU handling with `MTU = NICType::MTU - sizeof(Header)`
- Added `Data` type for message payload
- Ensures proper buffer size management
- Prevents buffer overflows

### 5. Static Methods and Members
- Changed send, receive, attach, and detach to static methods
- Made `_observed` a static member
- This aligns with the professor's implementation and provides better encapsulation
- Improves thread safety for shared resources

### 6. Message Processing
- Improved send method with proper packet construction
  - Allocates buffer with header and data
  - Sets header fields correctly
  - Handles memory management properly
- Enhanced receive method with proper packet processing
  - Extracts header information correctly
  - Sets sender address from packet header
  - Maintains proper buffer management

## Technical Details

### Header Class
```cpp
class Header {
    Port from_port() const;
    void from_port(Port p);
    Port to_port() const;
    void to_port(Port p);
    unsigned int size() const;
    void size(unsigned int s);
private:
    Port _from_port;
    Port _to_port;
    unsigned int _size;
};
```

### Packet Class
```cpp
class Packet: public Header {
    Header* header();
    template<typename T>
    T* data();
private:
    Data _data;
} __attribute__((packed));
```

### Send Method
```cpp
static int send(Address from, Address to, const void* data, unsigned int size) {
    Buffer* buf = _nic->alloc(to._paddr, PROTO, sizeof(Header) + size);
    Packet* packet = reinterpret_cast<Packet*>(buf);
    packet->from_port(from._port);
    packet->to_port(to._port);
    packet->size(size);
    memcpy(packet->data<void>(), data, size);
    return _nic->send(buf);
}
```

## Benefits
1. Improved message structure and handling
2. Better memory management and safety
3. Proper protocol number configuration
4. Enhanced thread safety
5. Better alignment with professor's implementation
6. Maintained compatibility with existing codebase

## Compatibility
The changes maintain backward compatibility with existing code while adding new features and safety improvements. The class interface remains largely the same, with additional methods for proper message handling and improved safety features.
