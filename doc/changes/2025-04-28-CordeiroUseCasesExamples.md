# Autonomous Vehicle Communication System - Use Cases

This document describes the key communication patterns and component interactions in our autonomous vehicle communication system, highlighting both internal and external communication scenarios.

## Component Categories

Our autonomous vehicle architecture divides components into functional categories:

### Sensor Components
Components that acquire data from the environment and vehicle state.

**Real-world examples:**
- Camera Component: Provides visual data (object detection, lane markings, traffic signs)
- LiDAR Component: Provides spatial point cloud data for 3D environment mapping
- INS Component: Provides precise position, orientation, and velocity data
- Radar Component: Provides object detection with distance and velocity measurements
- Ultrasonic Component: Provides short-range distance measurements for parking

### Processing Components
Components that analyze data and make decisions.

**Real-world examples:**
- Perception Component: Processes sensor data to create environmental model
- Planning Component: Generates routes and trajectories based on perception data
- Localization Component: Fuses sensor data for precise vehicle positioning
- Object Recognition Component: Classifies and tracks objects in the environment
- Traffic Analysis Component: Identifies road rules and traffic patterns

### Control Components
Components that execute decisions by manipulating vehicle actuators.

**Real-world examples:**
- Brake Component: Controls deceleration and stopping
- Steering Component: Controls vehicle direction
- Throttle Component: Controls acceleration and speed
- Transmission Component: Controls gear selection
- Suspension Component: Controls adaptive suspension settings

### Communication Components
Components that manage data exchange with external systems.

**Real-world examples:**
- V2X Component: Manages vehicle-to-everything communications
- Cellular Network Component: Handles mobile data connections
- WiFi Component: Manages local wireless networks
- Bluetooth Component: Handles short-range communications
- GPS Component: Receives positioning signals from satellites

## Communication Patterns

Our communication framework supports six distinct communication patterns based on:
1. **Transmission Type**: Unicast, Multicast, or Broadcast
2. **Communication Scope**: Internal (within vehicle) or External (between vehicles)

### 1. Unicast Internal Communication

**Use Case: Camera to Perception Target Tracking**

**Components Involved:**
- Camera Component: Provides visual detection data
- Perception Component: Receives and processes object detection data

**Communication Flow:**
1. Camera Component detects an object (e.g., pedestrian crossing)
2. Camera Component sends detection data directly to Perception Component
3. Perception Component receives data and updates object tracking

**Real-world Example:**
When a vehicle's front camera detects a pedestrian in a crosswalk, it directly notifies the perception system with precise coordinates for immediate processing, without needing to alert other vehicle systems. This point-to-point communication ensures minimal latency for safety-critical detection data.

**Communication Features:**
- Direct component-to-component communication
- Lower overhead than broadcast
- Targeted information delivery

### 2. Multicast Internal Communication

**Use Case: Lidar to Perception & Planning**

**Components Involved:**
- Lidar Component: Generates point cloud data
- Perception Component: Processes spatial data for object detection
- Planning Component: Uses spatial data for obstacle avoidance

**Communication Flow:**
1. Lidar Component generates environment point cloud
2. Lidar Component sends data to both Perception and Planning components
3. Both components process the data in parallel for different purposes

**Real-world Example:**
When a vehicle's LiDAR scanner detects multiple obstacles ahead, it simultaneously sends this data to both the perception system (to classify the obstacles as vehicles, pedestrians, etc.) and the planning system (to begin calculating potential evasive maneuvers). This parallel processing reduces response time for critical situations.

**Communication Features:**
- Efficient delivery to multiple interested components
- Reduces duplicate data transmission
- Enables parallel processing

### 3. Broadcast Internal Communication

**Use Case: INS Status Update**

**Components Involved:**
- INS Component: Provides position, orientation, and velocity
- All other components within the vehicle

**Communication Flow:**
1. INS Component updates vehicle position
2. INS Component broadcasts update to all components
3. Interested components use the positional data as needed

**Real-world Example:**
A vehicle's INS system determines an updated position, orientation, and velocity vector. This information is fundamental to almost all vehicle systems, so it's broadcast internally. The perception system uses it to align sensor data, the planning system uses it for route following, and the V2X system includes it in communications with other vehicles.

**Communication Features:**
- Simple implementation for widely needed data
- No need to specify recipients
- Can be filtered by recipients based on relevance

### 4. Unicast External Communication

**Use Case: V2X Direct Message**

**Components Involved:**
- Vehicle 1 V2X Component: Initiates communication
- Vehicle 2 V2X Component: Receives communication

**Communication Flow:**
1. V2X Component from Vehicle 1 needs to send specific data to Vehicle 2
2. V2X Component addresses message directly to Vehicle 2
3. Vehicle 2's V2X Component receives and processes the message

**Real-world Example:**
When two vehicles are negotiating a lane change in dense traffic, the changing vehicle sends a direct message to the vehicle that needs to make space, requesting acknowledgment and cooperation. This targeted communication ensures the specific vehicle receives and responds to the request without unnecessary network traffic.

**Communication Features:**
- Reliable point-to-point communication
- Confirmation of delivery possible
- Private communication between specific vehicles

### 5. Multicast External Communication

**Use Case: Perception Data Sharing**

**Components Involved:**
- Vehicle 1 Perception Component: Provides processed sensor data
- Vehicle 1 V2X Component: Transmits the data
- A group of nearby vehicles' V2X Components: Receive the data
- Other vehicles' Perception Components: Process the received data

**Communication Flow:**
1. Vehicle 1's Perception Component detects relevant objects
2. Data is shared via V2X Component to a specific group of vehicles
3. Receiving vehicles incorporate the shared perception data

**Real-world Example:**
At a complex intersection, a vehicle with a clear view shares its processed perception data (detected vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists) with a selected group of five nearby vehicles that have registered interest in this intersection. Only vehicles within this group receive the detailed perception information, extending their awareness beyond line-of-sight limitations.

**Communication Features:**
- Efficient delivery to relevant vehicles only
- Group membership can be dynamic based on location
- Reduces network congestion compared to broadcast

### 6. Broadcast External Communication

**Use Case: Emergency Alert**

**Components Involved:**
- Vehicle 1 Control Component: Detects emergency condition
- Vehicle 1 V2X Component: Broadcasts the alert
- All nearby vehicles' V2X Components: Receive the alert
- Other vehicles' Planning Components: React to the emergency

**Communication Flow:**
1. Vehicle 1's Control Component detects emergency braking
2. Emergency alert is broadcast via V2X to all nearby vehicles
3. Receiving vehicles process the alert and take appropriate action

**Real-world Example:**
When a vehicle performs emergency braking due to a sudden obstacle, it immediately broadcasts this event to all vehicles within communication range. This critical safety information is distributed regardless of which vehicles might need it, ensuring that any vehicle that could be affected will receive the warning with minimal delay.

**Communication Features:**
- Maximum reach for safety-critical information
- No need to determine recipients in advance
- Higher network utilization but justified for critical alerts

## Communication Framework Implementation Considerations

For each communication pattern, our implementation must address:

1. **Addressing Mechanism**
   - Unicast: Specific component/vehicle addressing
   - Multicast: Group membership management
   - Broadcast: Domain identification

2. **Reliability Requirements**
   - Delivery confirmation for critical messages
   - Timeout and retry strategies
   - Message priority handling

3. **Synchronization**
   - Time synchronization via PTP for consistent timestamps
   - Sequence numbering for message ordering
   - Handling of delayed or out-of-sequence messages

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Authentication for external communications
   - Message integrity verification
   - Access control for multicast groups

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Bandwidth management for different message types
   - Latency optimization for safety-critical communications
   - Resource utilization balance between communication patterns

Our implementation leverages the Observer pattern for internal communications and extends this with appropriate middleware for external communications, providing a unified API across all communication patterns.
