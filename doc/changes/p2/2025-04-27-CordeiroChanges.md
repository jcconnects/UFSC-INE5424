# Breaking Circular Dependencies Between Component and Message

## Overview

This change resolves circular dependency issues in the codebase, particularly between `component.h` and `message.h`. These circular dependencies caused compilation errors because the `TheAddress` type was being used before it was fully defined. The solution implemented a more robust type system with proper forward declarations and header organization.

## Key Changes

### 1. Created a Central Types Header

Created a new `types.h` header file that serves as a central location for:
- Forward declarations of template classes
- Constants shared across the system
- Type aliases that don't require complete type definitions

```cpp
// include/types.h
#ifndef TYPES_H
#define TYPES_H

// Forward declarations of template classes
template <typename Engine1, typename Engine2>
class NIC;

template <typename NIC> 
class Protocol;

template <typename Protocol>
class Communicator;

template <unsigned int MaxSize>
class Message;

// Forward declare Address before defining aliases
class Address;  // Protocol<NIC>::Address will be defined in protocol.h

// Concrete type definitions - without using inner types of incomplete classes
using SocketEngine = class SocketEngine;
using SharedMemoryEngine = class SharedMemoryEngine;
using TheNIC = NIC<SocketEngine, SharedMemoryEngine>;
using TheProtocol = Protocol<TheNIC>;
// TheAddress will be defined after Protocol is fully defined

// Constants
namespace Constants {
    constexpr unsigned int MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE = 1024; // Default value, adjust as needed
}

#endif // TYPES_H
```

### 2. Created Address Type Definition Header

Created a new `address.h` file that defines address-related types after all dependencies are fully available:

```cpp
// include/address.h
#ifndef ADDRESS_H
#define ADDRESS_H

// Include the actual engine implementation files first
#include "socketEngine.h"
#include "sharedMemoryEngine.h"

// Then include the protocol and types
#include "protocol.h"
#include "types.h"

// Now that Protocol is fully defined, we can define TheAddress
using TheAddress = TheProtocol::Address;
using TheCommunicator = Communicator<TheProtocol>;

#endif // ADDRESS_H
```

### 3. Reorganized Message Header

Updated `message.h` to use the new `address.h` instead of directly including `component.h`:

```cpp
// include/message.h
#ifndef MESSAGE_H
#define MESSAGE_H

#include <cstring>
#include "address.h" // Include for TheAddress type

template <unsigned int MaxSize>
class Message {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Origin Address getter/setter
    const TheAddress& origin() const;
    void origin(const TheAddress& addr);
    
private:
    // ... existing code ...
    TheAddress _origin; // Added origin address member
};

// Define the concrete message type using the constant from types.h
using TheMessage = Message<Constants::MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE>;

// ... implementation ...

#endif // MESSAGE_H
```

### 4. Reorganized Component Header

Updated `component.h` to use the new structure and include files in the correct order:

```cpp
// include/component.h
#ifndef COMPONENT_H
#define COMPONENT_H

// ... existing includes ...

// Include types.h for constants and forward declarations
#include "types.h"

// Include necessary headers 
#include "protocol.h"
#include "nic.h"
#include "socketEngine.h" 
#include "sharedMemoryEngine.h"
#include "communicator.h"
#include "address.h" // Include the address.h for TheAddress
#include "debug.h" // Include for db<> logging

// Forward declarations
class Vehicle;
// TheMessage is already defined in message.h - don't redefine

class Component {
    // ... existing code ...
};

// ... implementation ...

// Include message.h for TheMessage implementation
// This breaks the circular dependency by including it after the Component class declaration
#include "message.h"

#endif // COMPONENT_H
```

### 5. Updated Communicator Templates

Modified `communicator.h` to make its methods more flexible with template parameters:

```cpp
// include/communicator.h
// ... existing code ...

// Communication methods
template <unsigned int MaxSize>
bool send(const Address& destination, const Message<MaxSize>* message);

template <unsigned int MaxSize>
bool receive(Message<MaxSize>* message, Address* source_address);

// ... existing code ...

// Include message.h here to break circular dependency
#include "message.h"
```

### 6. Fixed Static Const Member Initialization

Resolved linker errors by adding definitions for static const members outside the class:

```cpp
// include/traits.h
// ... existing code ...

// Define the static const members outside the class
const unsigned int Traits<SharedMemoryEngine>::BUFFER_SIZE;
const unsigned int Traits<SharedMemoryEngine>::POLL_INTERVAL_MS;
const unsigned int Traits<SharedMemoryEngine>::MTU;

// ... existing code ...
```

### 7. Updated Test Files

Updated test files to match the current engine implementations:
- Fixed `sharedMemoryEngine_test.cpp` to use proper test structures and replace non-existent methods
- Fixed `socketEngine_test.cpp` to use the correct engine interface and simulate signals

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Type System**: Types are now defined in a more logical order, with forward declarations where needed.
2. **Compilation Fixes**: Resolved all compilation errors related to circular dependencies.
3. **More Maintainable**: The code is now better organized with a clearer dependency structure.
4. **Improved Template Usage**: The `Communicator` template is now more flexible, supporting various message sizes.

## Future Work

1. **Complete Test Fixes**: Some runtime errors remain in the component test that need to be fixed.
2. **Address Unused Variables**: There are still some warnings about unused variables in `SharedMemoryEngine::start()`.
3. **Consider Creating Full Types.h**: As suggested in comments, moving more type definitions to a dedicated types.h file could further improve organization.
