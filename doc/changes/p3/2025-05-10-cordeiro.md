# P3 - Component and Communicator Enhancements

## Overview

This document summarizes the core changes implemented to support the P3 time-triggered publish-subscribe communication system. These changes establish the necessary infrastructure for type-based message handling and component role differentiation.

## Changes

### 1. Added ComponentType Enum

- Created a ComponentType enum in `component.h` to identify component roles:
  ```cpp
  enum class ComponentType : std::uint8_t {
      UNKNOWN = 0,
      GATEWAY,
      PRODUCER,
      CONSUMER,
      PRODUCER_CONSUMER // Dual role component
  };
  ```
- Added `type()` method to Component class that dynamically determines a component's role
- Implemented `determine_component_type()` to detect:
  - Gateway components (port 0)
  - Producer components (have a _produced_data_type)
  - Consumer components (have active interests)
  - Dual-role components (both producer and consumer)

### 2. Enhanced Message Filtering in Communicator

- Updated Communicator::update() method to use ComponentType for intelligent filtering
- Implemented role-specific message delivery rules:
  - GATEWAY: Receives INTEREST and REG_PRODUCER messages
  - PRODUCER: Receives INTEREST messages for its produced data type
  - CONSUMER: Receives RESPONSE messages for its registered interests
  - PRODUCER_CONSUMER: Combines both producer and consumer rules
- Added period-based filtering for consumers to only process responses at their requested intervals

### 3. Fixed Circular Dependency Issues

- Properly resolved circular dependency between Component and Communicator
- Maintained forward declaration of Component in communicator.h for proper header separation
- Added safety validation for message buffer size to prevent memory access violations

### 4. Unit Test Refactoring

- Completely refactored the Message test implementation to use a dedicated test version
 
- Updated SocketEngine test to improve cross-platform compatibility:

- Removed obsolete test files:
  - component_test.cpp (the tests used to include other classes, so it was removed as it does not classify as a unit test anymore)
  - sharedMemoryEngine_test.cpp (no longer applicable to new architecture)

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Component class P3-specific implementations:
   - Verify component_dispatcher_routine implementation
   - Verify producer_response_routine implementation
   - Test thread management methods (start/stop)
   - Validate GCD calculation for producer response timing

2. Implement Gateway component with producer registry and message relay capabilities

3. Convert specific components to producers (Lidar, Camera, Battery, INS)

4. Implement consumer components (ECU) with interest registration

5. Test end-to-end publish-subscribe message flow
