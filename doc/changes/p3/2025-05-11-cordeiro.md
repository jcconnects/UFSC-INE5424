# Review of Communicator Implementation Fixes

## Summary
The changes focus on fixing compilation issues and improving the implementation of the Communicator class and related components in the communication framework. The modifications address type errors, circular dependencies, and inconsistencies in the API.

## Key Changes

### Fixed Circular Dependencies
- Reorganized header includes and added forward declarations to break circular dependencies
- Properly declared ComponentType enum in communicator.h instead of relying on external include
- Fixed forward declarations between Component, Communicator, and Protocol classes

### Fixed Class Inheritance
- Corrected initialization of base class in TypedDataHandler constructor
- Fixed the call to update() method in TypedDataHandler by using "this->" to access the base class method

### Template Parameter Consistency
- Updated all occurrences of NIC template to use both SocketEngine and SharedMemoryEngine parameters
- Fixed typo in SharedMemoryEngine class name (was "SharedmemoryEngine")
- Made template parameter declarations consistent across files

### Updated Communicator Interface
- Fixed method signatures to properly use the correct observed data type
- Modified update() method signature to match parent class
- Added a peek() method to Protocol class to read data without consuming it
- Improved Interest struct with period tracking capability
- Made add_interest() and remove_interest() return boolean status

### Test Updates
- Updated test cases to match the new Message constructor and API changes
- Fixed test_send_null_message to work with the new API that uses references

## Impact
These changes enable proper compilation of the communicator component and ensure type safety across the communication framework.
