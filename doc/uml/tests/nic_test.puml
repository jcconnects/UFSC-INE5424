title NIC Test - Sequence Diagram

actor "Test Harness" as Test
participant "Initializer" as Initializer
participant "NIC<SocketEngine>" as NIC
participant "StatsSnapshot" as Stats
participant "Ethernet::Address" as Address
participant "NIC::DataBuffer" as Buffer

note over Test: Initialize test

Test -> Initializer: create_nic(1)
Initializer -> Address: create addr (02:00:00:00:00:01)
Initializer -> NIC: create instance
Initializer -> NIC: setAddress(addr)
Test <-- Initializer: nic instance

note over Test: Test 1: Address Functions

Test -> NIC: address()
Test <-- NIC: defaultAddr
Test -> Test: verify defaultAddr != NULL_ADDRESS

Test -> Address: create testAddr (00:11:22:33:44:55)
Test -> NIC: setAddress(testAddr)
Test -> NIC: address()
Test <-- NIC: currentAddr
Test -> Test: verify currentAddr == testAddr

note over Test: Test 2: Buffer Allocation and Management

Test -> Address: create dstAddr (66:77:88:99:AA:BB)
Test -> Test: set protocol to 0x0800 (IPv4)
Test -> Test: set size to 100 bytes

Test -> NIC: alloc(dstAddr, prot, size)
Test <-- NIC: buffer
Test -> Test: verify buffer != nullptr

Test -> Buffer: data()
Test <-- Buffer: frame
Test -> Test: verify frame.src == nic.address()
Test -> Test: verify frame.dst == dstAddr
Test -> Test: verify frame.prot == 0x0800
Test -> Test: verify buffer.size() == size

Test -> NIC: free(buffer)

Test -> Test: allocate multiple buffers
loop 5 times
    Test -> NIC: alloc(dstAddr, prot, size)
    Test <-- NIC: buffer
    Test -> Test: store buffer in vector
end

Test -> Test: free all buffers
loop for each buffer
    Test -> NIC: free(buffer)
end

note over Test: Test 3: Statistics Tracking

Test -> NIC: statistics()
Test <-- NIC: stats
Test -> Stats: create initial snapshot
Test -> Test: verify all counters start at zero

Test -> NIC: send(nullptr)
Test <-- NIC: -1 (error)

Test -> NIC: statistics()
Test <-- NIC: updated stats
Test -> Stats: create updated snapshot
Test -> Test: verify tx_drops > 0

note over Test: Cleanup

Test -> Test: delete nic

note over Test: Test completed
