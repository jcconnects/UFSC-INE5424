**Revised Design Proposal: Integrated Communication Architecture for Autonomous Systems (with Lower-Level PTP/MAC Handling)**

This design outlines a comprehensive architecture for the communication library, addressing requirements P1 through P7 by establishing a two-tiered communication strategy and integrating security and time synchronization mechanisms directly into the lower network layers for efficiency and cleaner separation of concerns.

**1. Core Architectural Model:**
The system differentiates between two primary communication domains:
* **Internal Communication Domain**: Facilitates communication among components (POSIX threads) within a single autonomous vehicle (a POSIX process).
* **External Communication Domain**: Handles all communication between distinct autonomous vehicles, utilizing a full network stack that operates over raw Ethernet frames (P1).

**2. Internal Component Communication (Optimized Path - P2, P6):**
* **Central `CAN` Bus**: Internal communication is managed by a central, singleton object named `CAN` (Controller Area Network bus concept).
* **Direct Observer Pattern**: Components connect directly to the `CAN` object using the Observer/Observed pattern (e.g., based on `Concurrent_Observer` and `Concurrent_Observed` classes). This approach leverages the shared address space of threads within the process, bypassing the need for individual `Communicator` instances or a separate shared-memory `Engine` for purely internal exchanges.
* **Optimized Performance (P6)**: This direct in-process communication via method calls and notifications significantly reduces overhead for local messages by avoiding network stack processing. Timestamps or MACs for local messages, if required by an API call, are calculated on-demand.
* **Producer-Consumer Model (P2)**: This mechanism aligns with the producer-consumer model, synchronized using appropriate primitives (e.g., C++ standard library equivalents of pthreads primitives, as used in `Concurrent_Observer`/`Observed`). Components produce messages onto the `CAN`, and interested components consume them.
* **Message Integrity**: The `CAN` bus ensures that observers receive **clones of messages** to maintain data isolation and prevent concurrency issues between internal components.

**3. External Communication Infrastructure:**
External communication involves a layered stack: `SocketEngine` (raw Ethernet) -> `NIC` -> `Protocol` -> `Communicator`.

* **`SocketEngine`**: Provides the foundational layer for sending and receiving raw Ethernet frames (P1).
* **`NIC` (Network Interface Card Component - Enhanced Role)**: This component has a critical, enhanced role in this revised design:
    * **Outgoing Messages**:
        * **PTP Timestamping (P4)**: For *all* outgoing external messages (Interest, Response, STATUS, PTP), the `NIC` fetches the precise PTP-synchronized time from the `Clock` component and embeds/updates this timestamp directly into the message data before transmission.
        * **MAC Application (P5)**: For outgoing external **Interest** and **Response** messages, the `NIC` fetches the current group MAC key from `LeaderKeyStorage`, computes a Message Authentication Code (MAC) over the PTP-timestamped message data, and embeds/appends this MAC into the message data.
    * **Incoming Messages**:
        * **PTP Timestamp Processing (P4)**: The `NIC` extracts any PTP-relevant timestamps from incoming messages and passes this information to the `Clock` component (likely via the `Protocol` layer) to aid in PTP state machine updates and clock synchronization.
        * **MAC Verification (P5)**: For incoming external **Interest** and **Response** messages, the `NIC` extracts the MAC and the relevant message data, fetches the group MAC key from `LeaderKeyStorage`, and verifies the MAC. If verification fails, the `NIC` discards the frame, preventing unauthenticated or corrupted data from propagating up the stack.
    * This cross-layer approach at the `NIC` centralizes critical PTP timestamping and MAC security operations for external traffic, aiming for efficiency and a cleaner separation of these concerns from higher-level components like the `Gateway`.
* **`Protocol` Component**: Manages protocol-specific details (e.g., multiplexing/demultiplexing sessions over a single `NIC` using ports). It also plays a key role in PTP by:
    * Processing PTP-relevant information from messages (forwarded by the `NIC`).
    * Interacting with `LeaderKeyStorage` to determine the vehicle's PTP role (master or slave).
    * Driving the `Clock` component's PTP state machine.
* **`Communicator` Component**: Provides a message-oriented communication endpoint for higher-level components (`Gateway`, `Status`) to send and receive messages via a specific `Protocol` instance and address (MAC + Port).

**4. The `Gateway` Component:**
* **Sole External Conduit**: The `Gateway` remains the sole logical conduit for application-level messages (Interest, Response) entering or leaving the vehicle.
* **Dual Interaction**:
    * It acts as an **observer on the internal `CAN` bus** to receive messages from internal components that are destined for external broadcast.
    * It possesses its own `Communicator` instance (`CommGw`) for sending these messages to, and receiving messages from, the external network via the `Protocol` layer.
* **Simplified Role**: With MAC and PTP timestamping shifted to the `NIC`, the `Gateway`'s primary responsibilities for outgoing messages are now focused on:
    * Identifying messages from `CAN` that need external dispatch.
    * Constructing the appropriate external `Message` object (e.g., Interest type).
    * Forwarding this message to its `Communicator`.
    * For incoming messages (already MAC-verified and PTP-processed by `NIC`/`Protocol`/`Clock`), the `Gateway` receives them from its `Communicator` and publishes them to the internal `CAN` bus for interested local components.
* **Multi-threaded Operation**: The `Gateway` is designed to operate with at least two threads: one dedicated to handling notifications from the `CAN` bus (outgoing messages) and another for handling incoming messages from its `Communicator`.

**5. The `Status` Component (P5 - Secure Group Communication):**
* **Group Management**: This dedicated component manages inter-vehicle group dynamics.
* **Dedicated Communicator**: It uses its own `Communicator` instance (`CommStatus`), sharing the same underlying `Protocol` and `NIC` instances as the `Gateway`.
* **STATUS Broadcasts**: Periodically broadcasts `STATUS` messages containing its vehicle's age and a unique key/identifier. These messages are timestamped by the `NIC` using PTP time but are *not* subject to the group MAC applied by the `NIC` to Interest/Response messages.
* **Leader Election**: Maintains an internal, ordered list of neighboring vehicles based on received `STATUS` messages to facilitate the election of a group leader (e.g., based on age or another defined criterion).
* **Key Management Interface**: Interacts with `LeaderKeyStorage` to update the identity of the current group leader and, if leader, to manage/distribute the group's MAC key.

**6. `LeaderKeyStorage` Component:**
* A thread-safe, globally accessible (within the vehicle process) component that stores:
    * The identity of the current group leader.
    * The current group's session MAC key.
* It is updated by the `Status` component (specifically by the elected leader) and read by the `NIC` (for applying/verifying MACs and potentially by `Protocol`/`Clock` for PTP role determination).

**7. `Clock` Component (P4 - Temporal Synchronization):**
* **Internal Time**: Provides a singleton, consistent time source for all internal components, assumed to be perfectly synchronized within the vehicle process.
* **External PTP Synchronization**:
    * Contains the PTP state machine logic.
    * Its state machine is driven by the `Protocol` component, based on PTP-relevant information extracted or processed by the `NIC` from network messages.
    * Adjusts its time to synchronize with the PTP master of the group (the group leader).
    * Provides the precise PTP-synchronized time to the `NIC` for timestamping all outgoing external messages.

**8. Message Flow (Revised):**

* **Outgoing External Message (e.g., Interest):**
    1.  Internal Component (`ECUApp`) -> `CAN` (publishes data/intent).
    2.  `Gateway` (observes `CAN`) -> constructs external `Message` (e.g., Interest type).
    3.  `Gateway` -> `CommGw` (Gateway's Communicator) -> `Protocol`.
    4.  `Protocol` -> `NIC.send(buffer_with_message_payload)`.
    5.  `NIC` -> `Clock` (gets PTP time), `NIC` -> `LeaderKeyStorage` (gets MAC key for I/R messages).
    6.  `NIC` embeds PTP timestamp and (for I/R) MAC into the message payload within the Ethernet frame.
    7.  `NIC` -> `SocketEngine` -> Network.

* **Incoming External Message (e.g., Response):**
    1.  Network -> `SocketEngine` (receives raw frame).
    2.  `SocketEngine` -> `NIC.handle(frame)`.
    3.  `NIC` extracts PTP timestamp -> `Clock` (processes PTP info).
    4.  `NIC` extracts MAC (for I/R) -> `LeaderKeyStorage` (gets MAC key) -> `NIC` (verifies MAC; discards frame if invalid).
    5.  If valid, `NIC` -> `Protocol` (with verified application data).
    6.  `Protocol` -> `CommGw` (Gateway's Communicator).
    7.  `CommGw` -> `Gateway` (receives deserialized, verified message).
    8.  `Gateway` -> `CAN` (publishes message internally).
    9.  Internal Component (`ECUApp`) -> receives message from `CAN`.

* **STATUS Message Broadcast**:
    1.  `StatusComp` -> creates `Message` (STATUS type).
    2.  `StatusComp` -> `CommStatus` (Status's Communicator) -> `Protocol`.
    3.  `Protocol` -> `NIC.send(buffer_with_status_message)`.
    4.  `NIC` -> `Clock` (gets PTP time).
    5.  `NIC` embeds PTP timestamp into STATUS message payload. (No group MAC applied by NIC).
    6.  `NIC` -> `SocketEngine` -> Network.

**9. Addressing Specific Functional Requirements:**

* **P2 (Producer-Consumer)**: Addressed by the internal `CAN` bus using the Observer pattern.
* **P3 (Time-Triggered Publish-Subscribe)**: Internal components publish/subscribe via `CAN`. External Interest/Response messages facilitate data exchange between vehicles, managed by individual components for periodicity.
* **P5 (Secure Group Communication)**: Handled by the `Status` component (leader election, key management via `LeaderKeyStorage`) and the `NIC` (applying/verifying MACs for Interest/Response messages using the group key).
* **P7 (Mobility)**: Periodic re-broadcast of Interest messages by originating components ensures new neighbors become aware of data needs.

This refined design centralizes critical time-sensitive and security-sensitive operations (PTP timestamping, MAC processing) at the `NIC` level for all external communication, aiming for robustness and efficiency while maintaining a clear separation of concerns across the different components of the communication library.
