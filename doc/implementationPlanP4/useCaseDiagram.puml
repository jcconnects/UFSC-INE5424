' === Use Cases Definition ===

rectangle "Internal Vehicle Communication (via CAN)" {
  usecase "Publish Data Internally" as UC_Internal_Publish
  note bottom of UC_Internal_Publish
    <b>Intra-Vehicle Data Sharing</b>
    LidarApp, CameraApp, or ECUApp publish data
    (e.g., sensor readings, processed objects)
    onto the internal CAN bus. Other authorized
    internal components consume this data via
    an observer pattern. This addresses P2.
  end note
}

rectangle "External Inter-Vehicle Communication" {
  usecase "Request External Data (Interest Msg)" as UC_External_Interest
  note bottom of UC_External_Interest
    <b>Inter-Vehicle Data Request</b>
    An ECUApp (e.g., in Vehicle 1) determines a need
    for external data. It instructs its Gateway
    to broadcast an "Interest" message.
    The Gateway applies a MAC (P5) and uses PTP
    timestamps (P4). This addresses P3 & P7.
  end note

  usecase "Provide External Data (Response Msg)" as UC_External_Response
  note bottom of UC_External_Response
    <b>Inter-Vehicle Data Provision</b>
    An App (e.g., LidarApp in Vehicle 2) has data
    matching a received "Interest" message.
    It instructs its Gateway to broadcast a "Response"
    message with the data. The Gateway applies
    a MAC (P5) and uses PTP timestamps (P4).
    This addresses P3.
  end note
}

rectangle "Group Management & Security Services" {
  usecase "Broadcast Vehicle Status (STATUS Msg)" as UC_Group_StatusBroadcast
  note bottom of UC_Group_StatusBroadcast
    <b>Group Awareness & Formation</b>
    The StatusHandler in each vehicle periodically
    broadcasts a "STATUS" message containing its
    vehicle's age and key presence (P5).
  end note

  usecase "Manage Group Leadership & MAC Key" as UC_Group_Management
  note bottom of UC_Group_Management
    <b>Dynamic Group Security</b>
    StatusHandlers exchange STATUS messages to
    dynamically elect a group leader. The leader
    generates and ensures distribution/agreement of
    the MAC key for the current session (P5).
    The key is stored in LeaderKeyStorage.
  end note

  usecase "Ensure Message Authenticity (MAC)" as UC_Security_MAC
  note bottom of UC_Security_MAC
    <b>Data Integrity & Authenticity</b>
    The Gateway, for all outgoing external Interest
    and Response messages, generates and appends a
    Message Authentication Code (MAC) using the
    current group key (P5). It also verifies the MAC
    on incoming messages, discarding those that fail.
  end note
}

rectangle "Time Synchronization Services" {
  usecase "Synchronize Clocks (PTP)" as UC_Time_PTP
  note bottom of UC_Time_PTP
    <b>Network-Wide Time Coherency</b>
    The PTP Service (representing Protocol/Clock logic)
    in each vehicle participates in the Precision Time
    Protocol (PTP). Messages are exchanged, and clocks
    are synchronized to the PTP master (which is the
    current group leader) (P4, P5).
  end note
}
