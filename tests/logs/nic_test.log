Creating NIC instance
Testing address functions
Default address: 02:00:00:00:00:01
Asserting: Default address should not be null
PASS: Default address should not be null
Set address to: 00:11:22:33:44:55
Current address: 00:11:22:33:44:55
Asserting: Address should be updated to match the set address
PASS: Address should be updated to match the set address

Testing tx_drops increment with null buffer
Asserting: Send with null buffer should return -1
PASS: Send with null buffer should return -1
Statistics after null send: tx_drops=1
Asserting: tx_drops should be incremented after failed send
PASS: tx_drops should be incremented after failed send
