# Message Class Implementation Changes

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to the `Message` class implementation to improve its functionality, safety, and maintainability.

## Key Changes

### 1. Code Organization
- Separated class declaration from implementation for better maintainability
- Added clear section comments for constructors, operators, and getters
- Improved template implementation organization

### 2. Memory Safety Improvements
- Added proper copy constructor and assignment operator to prevent shallow copying
- Ensured proper memory initialization in constructors
- Fixed potential buffer overflow in constructor by using _size instead of size parameter
- Maintained MTU size limit enforcement

### 3. Const Correctness
- Removed redundant const from size() return type
- Maintained const correctness in data() method
- Added const correctness in copy constructor and assignment operator

### 4. Template Implementation
- Kept template implementations in header file for proper instantiation
- Added proper template parameter handling
- Improved template method organization

### 5. Added Features
- Added copy constructor for proper object copying
- Added assignment operator for proper object assignment
- Added self-assignment check in assignment operator

## Technical Details

### Constructor Changes
```cpp
Message(const T data, std::size_t size) { 
    _size = (size > MAX_SIZE) ? MAX_SIZE : size;
    memcpy(_data, data, _size);  // Using _size instead of size
}
```

### New Copy Constructor
```cpp
Message(const Message& other) : _size(other._size) {
    memcpy(_data, other._data, _size);
}
```

### New Assignment Operator
```cpp
Message& operator=(const Message& other) {
    if (this != &other) {
        _size = other._size;
        memcpy(_data, other._data, _size);
    }
    return *this;
}
```

## Benefits
1. Improved memory safety through proper copying
2. Better code organization and maintainability
3. Proper const correctness
4. Prevention of buffer overflows
5. Support for proper object copying and assignment

## Compatibility
The changes maintain backward compatibility with existing code while adding new features and safety improvements. The class interface remains the same, with additional methods for proper object copying.
